    "### Ans: Boosting is a popular ensemble technique in machine learning that involves combining multiple weak models to create a strong model. Unlike bagging, which trains multiple instances of the same model on different subsets of the data, boosting trains a sequence of models, with each subsequent model focusing on the instances that were misclassified by the previous model. By iteratively adjusting the weights of the misclassified instances, boosting can create a strong model that is more accurate than any individual weak model. Popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting. "

    "### Ans: Bootstrap is a resampling technique that is used to estimate the variability of a statistic or to make inferences about a population from a single sample. Bootstrap works by creating multiple resamples of the original dataset, with replacement, and using each resample to estimate the statistic of interest.\n",
    "### The steps involved in bootstrap are as follows:\n",
    "### Collect the original sample of data.\n",
    "### Randomly select a subset of the original sample, with replacement, to create a bootstrap sample. This means that each observation in the original sample has an equal probability of being selected multiple times or not at all.\n",
    "### Calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) on the bootstrap sample.\n",
    "### Repeat steps 2 and 3 multiple times to create many bootstrap samples and calculate the statistic of interest for each.\n",
    "### Use the distribution of bootstrap statistics to estimate the variability of the statistic of interest or to make inferences about the population.\n",
    "### Bootstrap is particularly useful when the underlying population distribution is unknown or non-normal, and when traditional statistical methods may be unreliable. By creating many resamples of the original data, bootstrap allows for a more accurate estimate of the variability of the statistic of interest and can provide more reliable inferences about the population."
