    "### Ans: A t-test and a z-test are statistical tests used to compare a sample mean to a population mean or to compare the means of two different samples. The main difference between a t-test and a z-test is that a t-test is used when the sample size is small or when the population variance is unknown, while a z-test is used when the sample size is large and the population variance is known.\n",
    "### A t-test is a statistical test that compares a sample mean to a known or hypothesized population mean when the sample size is small or when the population variance is unknown. For example, a researcher may want to test whether the mean height of a sample of 30 people is different from the mean height of the population. Since the population variance is unknown, the researcher can use a t-test to determine whether the difference between the sample mean and the population mean is statistically significant."

    "### Ans: One-tailed and two-tailed tests are two types of hypothesis tests used in statistics to evaluate the likelihood of a particular outcome.\n",
    "### A one-tailed test is a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis is stated in a way that suggests that the effect being tested occurs in only one direction. This means that the researcher is only interested in determining whether the effect is either greater than or less than a certain value. For example, a one-tailed test might be used to determine whether a new drug is more effective than an existing drug, or whether a new advertising campaign leads to an increase in sales.\n",
    "### In contrast, a two-tailed test is a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis is stated in a way that suggests that the effect being tested can occur in either direction. This means that the researcher is interested in determining whether the effect is either greater than or less than a certain value, but also whether it is simply different from that value. For example, a two-tailed test might be used to determine whether a new fertilizer increases crop yield, without making any assumptions about whether it increases or decreases it."

    "### Ans: A confidence interval is a statistical range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter of interest. In other words, it provides a range of values within which we can be reasonably confident that the true population value lies. Confidence intervals are commonly used in inferential statistics to estimate population parameters such as means, proportions, or variances based on a sample.\n",
    "### To calculate a confidence interval, we typically start by selecting a confidence level, which is the probability that the interval will contain the true population value. Common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%. The corresponding significance levels are 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively.\n",
    "### The formula to calculate a confidence interval depends on the parameter of interest and the distribution of the sample data. Here is an example of how to calculate a confidence interval for the population mean:\n",
    "### Suppose we want to estimate the average height of all the students in a particular school. We take a random sample of 100 students and measure their heights. The sample mean is 68 inches, and the sample standard deviation is 3 inches.\n",

    "### Ans: The margin of error in a confidence interval is the amount of error that we allow for in our estimate of a population parameter. It represents the range of values that we expect the true population parameter to fall within, given a certain level of confidence.\n",

In general, a larger sample size will result in a smaller margin of error, because a larger sample size reduces the variability of the data and increases the precision of our estimate.\n",

    "### Ans: We are given a sample of 30 participants with an average reaction time of 0.25 seconds and a standard deviation of 0.05 seconds.\n",
    "### We want to test if caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time using a one-sample t-test with a 90% confidence level. The null hypothesis is that there is no significant effect of caffeine on reaction time, while the alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant effect.\n",
    "### We can calculate the t-value using the formula: t = (x̄ - μ0) / (s/√n), where x̄ is the sample mean, μ0 is the hypothesized population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n",
    "### Assuming that the hypothesized population mean is also 0.25 seconds, the calculated t-value is 0. Since the calculated t-value is not greater than the critical value of ±1.699 at the 90% confidence level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant effect of caffeine on reaction time based on this sample."
