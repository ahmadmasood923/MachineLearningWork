    "### Ans: Supervised learning is a machine learning technique in which an algorithm learns to map input data to corresponding output labels or target values. The algorithm is trained on labeled examples, where the correct output labels are provided for each input. During training, the algorithm learns to make predictions on new, unseen data by finding patterns and relationships between the input and output variables.\n",
