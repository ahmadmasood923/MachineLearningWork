It is named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, who introduced it in the late 17th century. The Bernoulli distribution has two possible outcomes, which are usually denoted as 0 and 1, and a single parameter p that represents the probability of the event occurring.\n",

    "### Ans: he uniform distribution is a probability distribution that describes a situation where all possible outcomes of an experiment are equally likely. It is often used in situations where we have a continuous range of possible values, and we want to model the probability of selecting a value from that range.\n",

If the customer rolls a 1, 2, or 3, they win a 10% discount coupon; if they roll a 4 or 5, they win a 20% discount coupon; and if they roll a 6, they win a 50% discount coupon. This situation can be modeled using a discrete uniform distribution, where each of the six possible outcomes is equally likely to occur."

    "### Ans: The central limit theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It states that the sample means of a sufficiently large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution of the individual random variables. This means that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample means becomes closer and closer to a normal distribution.\n",
    "### The significance of the central limit theorem is that it provides a powerful tool for analyzing data, even in situations where we do not know the underlying distribution of the population. It also allows us to make more accurate estimates and predictions based on a sample of data, as we can use the normal distribution as an approximation for the distribution of the sample means."
