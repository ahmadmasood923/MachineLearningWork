    "### Ans: Missing values in a dataset refer to the absence of a value in a particular observation or feature of a dataset. They can occur due to various reasons such as human error, incomplete data collection, system malfunction, etc. Missing values can be represented as blank spaces, null, or NaN (not a number) values, depending on the type of data.\n",
    "### It is essential to handle missing values because they can significantly affect the results of data analysis, as they may lead to biased or incorrect conclusions. Also, some algorithms may not be able to handle missing values, and they may produce errors or incorrect results.\n",
    "### Here are some algorithms that are not affected by missing values:\n",
    "### Decision Trees: Decision trees can handle missing values by creating surrogate splits. In this approach, the missing values are replaced with the most frequent value or the mean of the corresponding feature, and then the tree is split as usual.\n",
    "### Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble method that uses decision trees. It can handle missing values by creating surrogate splits in the same way as decision trees.\n",
    "### k-Nearest Neighbors: K-Nearest Neighbors is a non-parametric algorithm that can handle missing values by ignoring the missing values in the distance calculation between observations.\n",
    "### Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm that can handle missing values by ignoring the missing values in the probability calculation.\n",
    "### Support Vector Machines: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can handle missing values by using a subset of observations that have complete data for training. SVMs find the optimal hyperplane based on the data available in the subset."

    "### Ans: Imbalanced data refers to a situation where the number of observations in one class or category is significantly higher or lower than the number of observations in another class or category in a classification problem.

However, this method can result in a loss of information and reduced sample size.\n",

This method can provide more accurate estimates and preserve the variability in the dataset.\n",

This method can be effective when there is a strong correlation between the missing variable and other variables in the dataset.\n",
