    "### Ans: Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. User is familiar with that \"what function does\" but they don't know \"how it does.\"\n",

Let's take another example - When we use the TV remote to increase the volume. We don't know how pressing a key increases the volume of the TV. We only know to press the \"+\" button to increase the volume."

    "### Ans: The main goal of the abstract base class is to provide a standardized way to test whether an object adheres to a given specification. It can also prevent any attempt to instantiate a subclass that doesnâ€™t override a particular method in the superclass. And finally, using an abstract class, a class can derive identity from another class without any object inheritance.\n",
    "###      It is necessary to verify whether an object implements a given method or property, especially while creating a library where other developers make use of it. A developer can use hasattr or isinstance methods to check whether the input conforms to a particular identity. But sometimes it is inconvenient to use those methods to check a myriad of different properties and methods. As a solution to this inconvenience, Python introduced a concept called abstract base class (abc). "

    "### Ans: Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved through creating abstract classes and inheriting them later. The classes that cannot be instantiated. This means that we cannot create objects of an abstract class and these are only meant to be inherited. Then an object of the derived class is used to access the features of the base class. These are specifically defined to lay a foundation of other classes that exhibit common behavior or characteristics.\n",
    "### The abstract class is an interface. Interfaces in OOP enable a class to inherit data and functions from a base class by extending it. In Python, we use the NotImplementedError to restrict the instantiation of a class. Any class having this error inside method definitions cannot be instantiated."

    "### Ans: Abstract classes are similar to interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private concrete methods. With interfaces, all fields are automatically public, static, and final, and all methods that you declare or define (as default methods) are public. In addition, you can extend only one class, whether or not it is abstract, whereas you can implement any number of interfaces."
