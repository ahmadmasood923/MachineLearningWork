    "### Ans: The spectral theorem is a powerful result in linear algebra that provides a characterization of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix. In the context of the eigen-decomposition approach, the spectral theorem tells us that any real symmetric matrix can be diagonalized using an orthogonal matrix.\n",

Moreover, since orthogonal matrices preserve lengths and angles, the diagonalization process preserves the geometric structure of the matrix, which can be useful in analyzing its properties and behavior."

PCA is widely used in image processing, computer vision, and data analysis.\n",

SVD is a powerful tool for data compression, noise reduction, and low-rank approximation of matrices. SVD is widely used in recommendation systems, text analysis, and signal processing.\n",
    "### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): LDA is a technique that uses Eigen-Decomposition to find a linear transformation that maximizes the separation between classes in a classification problem. By projecting the data onto this transformation, LDA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving the class separability. LDA is widely used in pattern recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing."
