    "### Ans:  A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data. Databases are widely used in various applications to store and manage large amounts of structured information.\n",
    "### SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, and architectural designs.\n",
    "### SQL Databases:\n",
    "### SQL databases use a structured data model based on tables with predefined schemas.\n",
    "### They enforce a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data is defined before data insertion.\n",
    "### They use SQL as the query language for managing and manipulating data.\n",
    "### SQL databases are generally suitable for applications that have complex relationships between entities and require strong data consistency, such as traditional relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "### They are known for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, which ensures data integrity.\n",
    "### NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "### NoSQL databases use various data models, including key-value, document, columnar, and graph, allowing for more flexible data representation.\n",
    "### They provide a dynamic schema, meaning the structure of the data can be altered on the fly.\n",
    "### They use different query languages, such as MongoDB's BSON query language or Cassandra Query Language (CQL).\n",
    "### NoSQL databases are generally suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media data, sensor data, or real-time data.\n",
    "### They offer high scalability and performance due to their distributed and horizontally scalable architecture.\n",
    "### NoSQL databases often prioritize scalability and availability over strict data consistency and may offer eventual consistency models."

    "### Ans: DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.

It allows you to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.\n",

    "### Ans: A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record (row) in that table. It serves as a unique identifier for each record and ensures the integrity and uniqueness of the data within the table. Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "### Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique. No two records in the table can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "### Non-nullability: The primary key column(s) cannot contain null values. Every record must have a valid value in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "### Indexing: By default, most database systems automatically create an index on the primary key column(s) to optimize search and retrieval operations.\n",
    "### Relationship establishment: Primary keys are often used to establish relationships between tables, particularly through foreign keys.\n",
    "### Foreign Key:\n",
    "### A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, known as the parent table and the child table. Here are some important aspects of foreign keys:\n",
    "### Relationship establishment: A foreign key in a child table references the primary key of the parent table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "### Referential integrity: Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, meaning that the values in the foreign key column(s) of the child table must match values in the primary key column(s) of the parent table.\n",
    "### Relationship types: Foreign key relationships can be classified as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, depending on the cardinality of the relationship.\n",
    "### Cascading actions: In some database systems, you can define cascading actions such as ON DELETE or ON UPDATE, which automatically propagate changes made to the primary key of the parent table to the associated foreign key values in the child table."
